<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this repository

This repository contains the necessary code to replicate the results presented in the manuscript "Functional and comparative genomics reveals conserved noncoding sequences in the nitrogen-fixing" [[1]](#1).

## Prerequisites

The code deposit in this repository integrates various software broadly applied in bioinformatics as well as in-home scripts. While the source code allows the reproduction of the results described in the paper, it is hard-coded for the genomes explored in the manuscript and tuned for execution in a [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) environment.

To generate the results presented in the publication, it is necessary the execution of multiple analytical steps. In this repository, the source code is organized in sessions that mimetic the mains analytical steps. A README file is present in each session (folder) with instructions and requirements for the execution of that analytical step.
